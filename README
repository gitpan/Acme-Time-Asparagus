Acme::Time::Asparagus

We have a clock in our kitchen that has vegetables rather than numbers.
You can see a picture of it at http://www.drbacchus.com/images/clock.jpg
Pretty cool, huh?

Sarah, our 4 year old, does not yet know how to tell time, and the other
night I told her that she needed to be ready to go somewhere by
asparagus. This got me thinking that it would be amusing to have a
module for conversion from regular time to vegetable time. And, if I got
particularly bored, the other direction.

So what is this really good for? Um. It's in the Acme namespace. It's
purely for my amusement.

Note that there are also a wide variety of sushi clocks available -
thanks to DrForr for this tip - which you can pick up at

---------------------

Version 1.02 adds 'before' as well as 'after', so that one has 'Onion
before Brussel Sprout', rather than 'Onion after Corn'. And now you can
just call veggietime() and have it default to the current time. Thanks
to sockmonk and phydeaux for appropriate VeggieTales quotes.
